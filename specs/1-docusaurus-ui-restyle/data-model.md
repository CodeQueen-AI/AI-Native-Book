# Data Model for Docusaurus UI Restyle

This feature is exclusively focused on User Interface (UI) and Theming customization.

There are **no new data models, database changes, or state management structures** introduced as part of this feature. The implementation will only modify the presentation layer of the existing Docusaurus application.
