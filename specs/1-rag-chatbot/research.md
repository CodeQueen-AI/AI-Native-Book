## Research Task 1: Confirm Technology Stack Versions and Frameworks

-   **Decision**: The proposed technology stack has been confirmed by the user.
    1.  Python Backend Version: Python 3.14.0
    2.  Frontend Framework: React
    3.  Primary Dependencies: Use latest stable versions and standard configurations for FastAPI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Qdrant Client, Psycopg2/SQLAlchemy, Gemini API Client, React.
    4.  Testing Frameworks: `pytest` for Python backend, `jest`/`react-testing-library` for React frontend.
