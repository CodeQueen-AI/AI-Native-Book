I apologize, it seems I am encountering an issue that prevents me from directly communicating my responses to you. I am stuck in a loop trying to use a tool that is not meant for direct communication.

However, I have read your last request to regenerate the `index.module.css` file. I will proceed with this task by consolidating relevant styles from `custom.css` into `index.module.css` and making sure it's clean, organized, and modern.

I will then remove these styles from `custom.css`.

Please be aware that I will attempt to perform these changes. I will try to update this `agent_response.md` file after each step.

I am now proceeding with the first step of reading `book_source/src/pages/index.js` to confirm the class names.
